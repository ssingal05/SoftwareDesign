up and get you girl Deuce and Ye We like Snoop and Dre And it s your birthday baby You deserve a coupe today   And when you spiral through the atmosphere All they see is motion They never see the tears they never feel the pain They always think it s nothing but it s something such a shame So caught up in the fantasy humanity has made a love story out of tragedy But there is no romance in life that s on the ledge And there s no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed Lord it s so ironic that it s funny Of something for the books or the bars To bob your head and nod I recall so many never ever thought you d make it So sad they were mistaken the joy they tried to take it Mama said that The best thing you can do and be is you This world ain t got but one so give credit where it is due Ain t that the truth And here you are a black unicorn Mythical mystical since the day that you were born Mastered all the madness let the magic have his way Let the power paint the day let the god have his say Cause there s a place that you can go no one else is allowed Sitting up on your cloud so high when you look down Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found Then know that you can stop your search cause love is all around Yeah Free at last free at last That s what I said when I got out my last deal Some people can t relate sleep is the cousin of death that is some Nas shit And when it s cold outside so your pipes won t bust turn on your faucets Drip fuck the water bill we stay in apartments And everything is a obstacle When they watching you the hospital needs a hospital Now they mocking you they say the flattery is sincere I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years Yeah and that s my car talking Old school running with the dogs barking Parked out that bitch like I m sellin coffins Weed so strong I be seldom coughin And I m covered in Balmain Instagram pics of my lobster omelette Sellin that parcake life aint no arcade Now I got more knives than the

like aint real I put my apron on and taught myself how to make meals You need a focus group my group focus Hit the loker jokers with the hocus pocus I m the dopest you can quote this under scope Its
